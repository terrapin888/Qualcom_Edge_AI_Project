**AI Email Management Desktop App**

> An open-source on-device conversational AI email client desktop application that leverages your local PC's NPU

---

## Application Description

MailPilot AI is an AI email management application that integrates with Gmail accounts to automatically classify and summarize emails, generate AI-based auto-replies, and other features. It adds convenience to email usage by providing functions that email users have not been able to utilize before, offering these features through a conversational interface.

This desktop app was developed using React and Flask frameworks with Tauri, running AI models on Qualcomm Copilot+ PC NPUs to minimize dependency on existing cloud-based environments.

### Key Features Using AI Models

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Spam/Important/Sent/Self-sent/Filtered | Automatically classify and view emails by tabs |
| Email Summary View | Preview email content summaries in the list view |
| Sender Search Function | Filter emails by sender |
| To-Do (Task Management) Display | Automatically organize and provide user's key schedules |
| Attachment Summary Function | Automatically summarize attached images and document content |
| AI Auto-Reply Generation | Generate automatic replies for received emails |
| Conversational Interface | Grammar correction, calendar content addition, search functions, and other email management features |

## MySQL Database Setup
This project uses a MySQL database. Before running the project, you must create a database named mailpilot and configure the database connection information in the config.py file.

### 1. Create MySQL Database
Use a MySQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, terminal) to create the mailpilot database.

CREATE DATABASE mailpilot;

### 2. Configure Database Connection
In the project's root directory, create a config.py file and enter the MySQL connection information as shown below.

SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'mysql+mysqlconnector://root:@localhost/mailpilot'
SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = False

The configuration above assumes a connection to the mailpilot database on localhost with the root user and no password. If you are using a different username or password, please modify the format below accordingly.

SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'mysql+mysqlconnector://your_username:your_password@localhost/mailpilot'

### 3. Run the Server
Once the MySQL setup is complete, please follow the backend server installation and execution instructions to run the backend server.
The required database tables will be created automatically upon server startup, based on the Flask-SQLAlchemy configuration.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Security
- **Never use your regular Gmail password**
- Must use app password
- Gmail 2-step verification must be activated

### System Requirements
- Backend API server must be running first
- Internet connection required (for Gmail access and AI model usage)

### Token Issuance Required
- Currently requires tokens from Hugging Face due to lack of Qualcomm devices, as specified in app.py
- Need to obtain tokens from Nomic and Hugging Face and modify accordingly
- Future plans to use Qualcomm AI hub to download models for local use
